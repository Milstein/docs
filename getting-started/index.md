To help you get started with the API we've put together a number of guides and packages. Each of these are designed to get you up and running as fast as possible and ease the initial processes involved.

#### [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication)
Before using the API you must first authenticate with it, this will allow it to retrieve the correct data for your account as well as keep your data safe and secure. For anyone already familiar with OAuth from other places this should be a very easy process, for those not so you'll find all the help you need.
