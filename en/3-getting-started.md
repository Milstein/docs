For the purposes of this documentation we presume you already have a good working knowledge of how to use the [PyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com) administration panel including how to upload and install modules. If not we suggest you do so before continuing.

### [Installation](/documentation/getting-started/installation)

Before continuing to the [installation](/documentation/getting-started/installation) guide, you will need to download a copy of FireSale, this can be done from a number of places, including the [PyroStore](https://www.pyrocms.com/store/details/firesale_ecommerce_platform) and the latest version is always available from our [GitHub](https://github.com/firesale/firesale) account.

Once uploaded to your server you can then follow the guide to get up and running with your new store in moments.

### [Changelog](/documentation/getting-started/change-log)

This is where you can follow the changes from version to version as well as see any bugs that you should be aware of if you're still running an older copy of FireSale. Where possible we suggest you upgrade to the latest version but understand this may not be the case - in these situations we have linked to the issue tracker for the relevant bug so you can see how severe they are as well as the relevant code needed to fix them so you can patch it manually.

### [Languages](/documentation/getting-started/languages)

You can view the languages FireSale is available in as well as details for aiding us in continued or future translations. To give users around the globe the best possible experience and to reach the widest audience we're always trying to get more or improved translations and if you can help with this we're always interested to hear from you.


### [Licenses](/documentation/getting-started/licenses)

Here you can find out about the various licenses that we use to distribute the different parts of FireSale and how they affect you and what can be done with them.
