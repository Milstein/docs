## Managing Categories

Categories can be re-ordered in the "Manage Categories Panel" by dragging and dropping. Categories can also be made into a sub-category by this method.

## Editting a Category

To edit a category select it from the manage categories panel. Make any changes in the form and when you are done click the "Edit Category" button beneath the form to save the changes.

## Deleting a Category

The first category, default name of "Uncategoried", can only be editted and not removed. This is due to when a category is deleted all the products in this category get moved to the default category. It is therefore important to keep this default category around so products are always assigned to atleast one category.
